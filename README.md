# R-Style-Guide
Not about making your code "pretty"! Our goal here is to make code that has 
fewer bugs and is easier to maintain and extend.

## Why It's So Important

If you are writing code that you or others will be using in the future,
it is absolutely essential that write "good" code, meaning:

* It is easy to understand, both by others and *by yourself*, six months
  later.  This facilitates debugging, and adding new features.

* It is robust to errors, in that it does error checking and messaging.
  Especially important is avoiding "silent" errors, i.e. ones that do
not cause execution to cease but cause possibly major damage in the
output, undetected.
